1. Is it really necessary to have "Add story" functionality? Since this is a time reporting system adding stories and administration can/should be done through JIRA and only reporting functionalities should be implemented to avoid duplication of functionalities in separate systems.

2. What do you mean by allow non-stories? To allow adding them or...? Can it be done by story types?
